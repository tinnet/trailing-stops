# Trailing Stop-Loss Configuration

# List of ticker symbols to track
# Format: "TICKER" or "TICKER:PRICE" (where PRICE is your entry price)
tickers = [
    "AAPL",         # Uses current price
    "AMD",          # Uses current price
    "SHOP.TO",      # Uses current price
    "NVDA",         # Uses current price
]

# Example with entry prices:
# tickers = [
#     "AAPL:150.50",    # Entry price $150.50
#     "AMD:180",        # Entry price $180
#     "SHOP.TO:200",    # Entry price $200 CAD
#     "NVDA",           # No entry price - uses current price
# ]

# Default stop-loss percentage (0-100)
# This is the percentage below the current price (simple) or high-water mark (trailing)
stop_loss_percentage = 5.0

# Enable trailing stop-loss by default
# If true, stop-loss will track the highest price seen from historical data
# If false, stop-loss is calculated from current price only
trailing_enabled = false

# Optional: Specify buy dates for specific tickers (for trailing mode)
# The tool will fetch historical data starting from these dates
# Format: YYYY-MM-DD
# [buy_dates]
# AAPL = "2024-01-15"
# AMD = "2024-06-01"

# ATR (Average True Range) Configuration
# ATR adapts stop-loss to each stock's volatility
# atr_period = 14  # Number of days for ATR calculation (industry standard)
# atr_multiplier = 2.0  # Multiplier for stop-loss distance (1.5=tight, 2.0=normal, 3.0=loose)
